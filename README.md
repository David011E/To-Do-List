    ## **UX Development**

## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

The selected color scheme was thoughtfully chosen to convey a distinct visual identity that aligns with the project's overall design philosophy, creating a cohesive and engaging user experience.

### **Typography**

As the main focus of the site is the messages that people are sending, I have only used one font throughout the site to prevent users becoming overwhelmed.

Fira sans was imported from google fonts. It is a sans-serif font which is accessible friendly.

### **Wireframes**

The entire site's wireframe was done using [mockflow wireframes](https://www.mockflow.com/).This depicts the site on a desktop and a mobile device.
