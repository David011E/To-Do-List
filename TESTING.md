Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. We utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we went along.

The page has been inspected using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that the page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. I have also physically tested the responsiveness of the site on a number of different devices.
